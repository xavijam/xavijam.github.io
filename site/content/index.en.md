I'm Javier √Ålvarez, and I love Gentoo penguins, and websites where favicon is an important part of the page.

These hobbies appeared when I started as intern at [Vizzuality](http://vizzuality.com) in 2009. For 4 years we developed several applications focused on data visualization, either geospatial like [Spain election](http://datos.rtve.es/elecciones/autonomicas-municipales/index.html) for [RTVE.es](http://rtve.es), or any other kind, for example [the evolution of the web](http://vizzuality.com/projects/web-evolution), a project for [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html).

Although what we liked the most was to help the environment, projects like [catalogue Antarctic species](http://vizzuality.com/projects/antarctic) (where I started to follow penguins closely) or how to prevent the deforestation in any place of the world with [Global Forest Watch](http://vizzuality.com/projects/global-forest-watch), helping to [World Resources Institute](http://www.wri.org/).

After that adventure, Vizzuality started to develop its own product, called [CARTO](http://carto.com). An [Open Source](http://github.com/cartodb/cartodb) project which helps from scientifics, journalists or companies to understand better their geospatial data or even publish a simple but incredible map in minutes.

I've been working there for 5 years, starting as Frontend, then Frontend Lead, [Builder](https://carto.com/blog/welcome-to-carto-builder/) Team Lead and Head of Technology for the last months.

I really enjoy developing the Frontend UI of any aplication, but also I've interested in how to help other companies to grow their development teams, find that tool that could help the management workflow or just following what it is going on in the Open Source community.
