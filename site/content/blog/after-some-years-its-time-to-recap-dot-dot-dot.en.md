I started in [Vizzuality](http://vizzuality.com) several years ago and after some projects done, lot of friends made and many hours worked, it's time to recap and look back to understand what we have achieved.

timeline.jpg)

I've simply <strike>followed</strike> copied the Facebook timeline trend to visualize some of the most important days in this group of friends (still adding days, not finished!).

I've used [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com) as backend, the code is in [GitHub](https://github.com/xavijam/vizzuality-timeline) and you can see it [here](http://xavijam.github.io/vizzuality-timeline).

Thank to all the vizz crew for put up with me everyday, and also, thanks to all the people who helped us and now they aren't here, my best wishes in their new adventures.
