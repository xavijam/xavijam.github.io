It is likely I will be at FOSS4G Denver conference talking about HTML5 for Rich Geospatial applications on the web.

It will happen on Friday 15th, at 10am. I have to say that my english is very poor, but I will do my best to do it properly :).

One more thing! Presentation will be online for everybody the same day after the talk [here](http://xavijam.github.com/html5-foss4g/).
