I didn't expect to deceive anyone so soon, my more optimistic cabals pointed to get back to work in March, but honestly this new adventure looks pretty good and gives me everything I've been looking for since I left my favorite video game, CARTO.

Help to build something from (almost) scratch, in a small team, multidisciplinary, where any action you do is going to have an immediate impact on the group. And I say group because right now there are 5 of us. I was looking forward to getting back to the Vizzuality era, where a new challenge appeared every 2 months. Freedom to create something unique, we delivered it, happy customer, celebration and the following week we were already struggling facing the next one.

And that's what is happening in [7r] (https://7r.ventures) in a certain way. But with some nuances and incentives. This is not a consultancy agency, **7r creates companies**. An ingenious idea appears, a client who wants it, and there is where we come in. We give ourselves a deadline to create a first version, validated and supported by the first client. Then a company is created around this project, because it has a future path, a client that has validated it and is economically profitable. And we are ready for the next challenge.

And I speak of challenge because there is no project where we do not have to work with some hardware, with new terminology or use some technology that we hadn't heard before. And that's the good thing, the comfort zone is eliminated, because this is about working in 7r, having the [adventurous gene](https://7r.ventures/manifesto/) awake.

But this adventure has just begun and we need people with whom we can share it. [We are looking for another developer](https://7r.ventures/job/hacker-in-residence/) with whom I would work side by side to carry out that first phase of the creation of the project.
Great base salary + bonus when projects are finished, remote work if you want (although we like to work together some days in [Google Campus](https://goo.gl/NFGAeB)), no fancy or extravagant perks, transparency, great team environment.

If you have doubts or curiosity, just ping me.
