Personal website done with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and based on [Atlas Hugo template](https://github.com/indigotree/atlas).

```
brew install hugo
npm install
npm run server
```

### Release

Any branch merged into `master` branch will trigger a production build thanks to [Travis](http://travis-ci.org).
