Personal website done with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io). Based on [Atlas Hugo template](https://github.com/indigotree/atlas) and [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo).

### Development

Taking for granted you have installed [node](http://nodejs.org) and you are using one of the latest versions.

```
brew install hugo
npm install
npm run server
```

### Release

Any branch merged into `development` branch will trigger a production build thanks to [Travis](http://travis-ci.org).
