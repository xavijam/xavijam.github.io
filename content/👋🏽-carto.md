I have really abandoned my blog, actually I didn't comment the big change in CARTO since 2014 or the branding change to CARTO in 2016<sup>1</sup>. Whatever, there will be time to explain them, I'll try to write from time to time this 2018.

Today I wanted to mention something less interesting. One week ago I left CARTO, and I have to admit it was the toughest decision I've ever taken. Because part of my life is (and will be) this company, is (and will be) this group of people, is (and will be) to fulfill this illusion.

And you may know, when you experience so many emotions and adventures over 9 years, you need to stop, rest, recharge your batteries and find a new adventure where to help. And this is the way I communicated my leaving to the team  (but in tears):

Who loves video games? I do, and it is likely you too. I guess you are wondering, why is he talking about video games now? Because CARTO (previously known as Vizzuality) is like an old great video game, an arcade video game, which I‚Äôve inserted coins every day for almost 9 years.
</br></br>
And I can proudly say I‚Äôve passed several levels (with better or worse results), with its monsters and its rewards included.
</br></br>
Today, unfortunately, I can‚Äôt find more pocket coins to insert, I don‚Äôt feel the same energy than before to kill those final monsters, to pass that impossible level, to win that precious reward.
</br></br>
But, wait, the countdown to insert a new coin has started, and I don‚Äôt want anybody to give up. You are a very good player (don't have doubts), you have the right weapons, you know the path to the end of the level, and you know how to kill that final monster.
</br></br>
Take your coin, insert it and keep the game on. I'll be close to you watching how you complete the video game, and if I can help with the Konami code, I‚Äôll be there.
</br></br>
Thanks to all of you, really, thank you. There isn't (and there won't) enough time to thank everybody I‚Äôd like to, those you are and those you were here.
</br></br>
But a special thank you to [@jorgesancha](http://twitter.com/jorgesancha), who has moved land and sky to find me a new position last months. And thanks to [@saleiva](http://twitter.com/saleiva) and [@jatorre](http://twitter.com/jatorre), because you teach me how to play old nice video games, and now, in the future, I‚Äôll try to find a lost coin in the floor to start a new video game, but not that awesome, maybe the Tetris.
