Everybody has looked for a house at some point in their lives, and it's not an easy job. Some months ago was my turn, and I dove into one of the most important real estate portals in Spain called
[Idealista](http://www.idealista.com). Really simple and easy to find a house or flat that fits for you. But (there is always a but) I realized they don't use any kind of maps to represent the districts and neighborhoods, in fact, they use map images.

Thanks to this I decided to do an alternative using [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com) and [Leaflet](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com).
Just a simple interactive example of Madrid districts and neighborhoods.

You can visit the example [here](http://xavijam.github.io/idealista). The code, as always, is in [GitHub](https://github.com/xavijam/idealista), and the data is available in this [CartoDB table](https://xavijam.cartodb.com/tables/5275/public) (amount on sale or rent houses are bogus).

**UPDATED:** Thanks for the corrections [@javier](http://twitter.com/javier) :).
