    <p>In 2009, while I was finishing my Computer Scientist Degree at Rey Juan Carlos university in Madrid, I started as intern in <a href="http://vizzuality.com" class="vizzuality">Vizzuality</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    At the beginning I learnt how to develop small RIAs with Flash technology, but after some time and projects done, I realized my real passion was pointing to the Front-End development.
    <br/><br/>
    Anti-flash self-confessed, I love new web technologies and I'm always ready to try them out. Focus on HTML, CSS (SASS, LESS, <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>,...), JavaScript (<a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a>, ...), maps libraries (<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/">Google Maps</a>, <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a>,...) and hardly ever Ruby.
    <br/><br/>
    Today I work as UI Developer transforming wireframes into real web applications, and I'm putting all my efforts and love on <a href="http://cartodb.com" class="cartodb">CartoDB</a>, a geospatial database in the cloud.
    <br/><br/>
    I am interested neither in a new job nor in big and paid conferences. I only trust meetups where people are worried to help other people, selflessly.
