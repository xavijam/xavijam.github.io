    <p>The day started as usual, monday 9am, some walk, take the subway, some walk more and finally Vizzuality office. Another good work day for developing a feature for CartoDB, or maybe fix any of the bugs I have in my pending list, whatever. The only thing that broke the common day was <a href="http://twitter.com/javisantana" title="Javier Santana">@javisantana</a> presence, he usually comes on Tuesday, but this day happened to be special.</p>

  <h4>How it happened</h4>
  <div class="columns-content">
    <p> 
      I received a call from <a href="http://twitter.com/saleiva" title="Sergio Álvarez">@saleiva</a> after our team breakfast, he and <a href="http://twitter.com/jatorre" title="Javier de la Torre">@jatorre</a> required some of the team to hold a meeting, maybe some good news for CartoDB, maybe not?. Vizzuality, which has been bootstrapping the company up to now, was looking for a venture capital since some months, that doesn't mean we needed money, we wanted to push harder and faster CartoDB to the next level.
      <br/><br/>
      Bad news started when they recognized that our first and main option won't happen. The offer seemed to be pretty, but not good enough and negotiations were harder than expected, game over. But these guys had another bullet in the gun, option B, maybe not planned. No matter how, Google asked about the process, and if there was any possibility to talk with us, they wanted to adquire Vizzuality... Yes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" title="Google Inc">Google Inc</a>, one of the most important technology companies.
      <br/><br/>
      We developed some projects with them in the past (<a href="http://vizzuality.com/projects/imazon" title="Imazon">Imazon</a>, <a href="http://vizzuality.com/projects/endangeredlanguages" title="Endangered languages">Endangered languages</a>, <a href="http://vizzuality.com/projects/evolutionofweb20" title="Evolution of the web">Evolution of the web</a>,...), and still running one more with their collaboration (<a herf="http://vizzuality.com/projects/gfwprototype" title="Global Forest Watch">Global Forest Watch</a>). I have to say that only mention that we have created applications or visualizations for this guys is awesome, and probably I wouldn't have expected anything higher in my entire career.
      <br/><br/>
      After the shock and some tears (I can't leave to mention) Vizz founders explained us some more details about the meetings with them, nothing really "important" to describe, just one thing, "we have to travel to San Francisco this week", what?. Google wanted to know more about us, how CartoDB works, meet the team and check if Vizzuality is worth it. And the possibility of the trip came up.

    <p>
      As someone can understand, next days I couldn't sleep very well, millions of feelings and situations overloaded my mind every night. Until wednesday rest of the team didn't meet the situation. "Hello guys, we have good news, Google wants to meet us, we flight on Saturday to SFO... let's be ready!". That happened in a park close to our office, with almost the whole team (I can't forget <a href="http://twitter.com/strk" title="Sandro Santilli">@strk</a>), weird scenario, weird situation, no much time for reaction. I will never forget team faces.
      <br/><br/>
      Next days were crazy. We started to talk in english between us (we used to use it on meetings, trips and via email) and prepared the interviews. Yes, interviews would take part of the circus, and we should be ready, <a href="http://twitter.com/saleiva" title="Sergio Álvarez">@saleiva</a> helped and pushed us a lot, thanks for your efforts man. Three days describing ourselves, reviewing CartoDB demos, showing us on public with our english (managed and improved thanks to our teach Pablo), making recursive exercices,... several necessary stuff.
      <br/><br/>
      Something really big, but we wouldn't be able to say a word about it. No friends, no family in my case (sorry a lot), no office collegues (<a href="http://simbiotica.es" title="Simbiotica">Simbiotica</a>), no our Vizzuality friend <a href="http://twitter.com/ferdev" title="Fernando Espinosa">@ferdev</a>, was hard, but we were really focus on the "thing" instead of managing the secret outsite the crew. In my case I prefered to prevent my family and friends from something that could never happen.

  <h4>Been there</h4>
  <div class="columns-content">
    <p>
      Saturday came up, and we landed in SFO. I was looking forward to visiting this place some years ago, but nobody would guess the reasons of my first visit to this city. We did some tourist on Sunday, trying to relax troops. Golden gate was amazing despite the fog, and the city seemed like I imagined, perfect for living, nice for enjoying, smart and restless people on it.
      <br/><br/>
      We visit Google HQ on Monday, lead Geo team was there, included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_McClendon" title="Brian McClendon">Brian McClendon</a>, was incredible. This guy finished his conference about <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/0/" title="Google Maps Engine lite">Google Maps Engine Lite</a> and met us for half hour, another big thing I won't ever forget. After an informal meeting about what Google is, what they expected from us, or how the interviews would be, we had dinner with Geo team in Palo Alto, there we had the opportunity to know more about all the things around and related to this company. Such nice people, they helped a lot and answered all our questions, and of course, the food was incredible :).
      <br/><br/>
      But interviews started on Tuesday and continued on Wednesday, no time for a cocktail, bed soon and rest if possible. I can't say anything about interviews process, but they aren't as anybody can find in internet. They help you a lot, repeat problems as many as you need and they contribute with your solution. Meet some of the most intelligent people in the world is always a pleasure. But yes, jitters came up easily.
      <br/><br/>
      We decided to take some beers with the Geo team on Tuesday night, pretty weird situation drinking and joking with your morning interviewer, but was a great time. Interviews finished and we had a tour around the whole Mountain View campus. What a huge and amazing place at the same time! These guys know how to make feel employees more happy. Unfortunately, time was over, and next day we flew back to Madrid, arriving on Friday. Damm, 9 hours of difference are really hard to manage.

      The end of the story is already known. This boring adventure only reminds me that Vizzuality started in a room for 2 people almost 5 years ago, with millions of dreams, and someday, they will come true.
