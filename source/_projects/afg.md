              Supporting amateurs and scientist their preparation for a trip to Antarctica.
              I have to say it is one of my favourite projects, where I found a strong passion for penguins... did I?

    <p>
      When I started at <a href="http://vizzuality.com" class="vizzuality">Vizzuality</a>, I first learnt the projects we develop will help researching scientific world and environment and this project could be a perfect example.
      <br/><br/>
      With this web application we could explore Antarctica, all its biodiversity, the research stations,... and of course met my favourite animals, Gentoo penguins.
      In a month project, we helped scientist and amateurs their preparation for a trip to this wonderful continent.
      We develop our own <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles">tiles</a> and we use them over OpenLayers with a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Antarctica">specific projection</a>. All of this for rendering properly the features in the map.
      <br/><br/>
      Also we transformed our taxonomy browser developed in Flash (<a href="http://www.mountainbiodiversity.org/tool.html">http://www.mountainbiodiversity.org/tool.html</a>) to JavaScript (<a href="http://afg.scarmarbin.be/species">http://afg.scarmarbin.be/species</a>).
