excerpt: |
              My childhood football team was in trouble after a bad management, how to help them?.
              I designed, developed and maintained their website along three years. It meant my first experience with <a href='http://wordpress.org'>Wordpress</a> and PHP.

      When I was young I played in an amateur football team, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Betis_San_Isidro">Betis San Isidro</a>. They were in trouble after a bad management, and when they asked me for help I didn't have any doubt.
      <br/><br/>
      This was my first serious experience with PHP (I still remember our first PHP project in Vizzuality, Runnity, mentioned in <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com.es/2010/05/viewing-biodiversity-with-google-maps.html">Google Maps Mania</a>) and Wordpress.
      <br/><br/>
      I designed and developed a specific layout/theme for the team (available in <a href="http://github.com/xavijam">my GitHub account</a>), did the maintenance of the website, updated every week the team info and posted some news :D.
      <br/><br/>
      Unfortunately the adventure finished in 2012 when a new board arrived to the team and decided to use resources paid.
