      CartoDB is a geospatial database on the cloud that allows for the storage and visualization of data on the web. User could create dynamic maps, analyze and build location aware and geospatial applications with your data using the power of <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> in the cloud.
      <br/><br/>
      It was released as a Beta version at <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/">Denver FOSS4G</a> in September 2011, and nowadays we are working hard on the second version of the application.
      <br/><br/>
      The tool uses JavaScript extensively, including use in the front-end web application and back-end <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> based APIs for the client libraries.
      <br/><br/>
      We have built the tool on a stack of some of our favorite open-source technologies, including, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>, <a href="http://mapnik.org/">Mapnik</a>, and our very own <a href="https://github.com/CartoDB/Windshaft">WindShaft</a>. CartoDB is no different, you can find the code in our <a href="https://github.com/CartoDB/CartoDB">git repository</a>.
      <br/><br/>
      I've spent last years working on the client-side, UI and front-end develpoment, based mainly on <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> library.
