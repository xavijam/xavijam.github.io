  <p>Run out of fuel. Those are the perfect words to explain what's going on with <a href="http://libr.in" title="Librin">libr.in</a>.
  Several months ago I started a great personal project, with lot of illusion, energies and hopes. Today
  this project is really advanced, but only in the programming part, almost with the 72% of the job done.</p>
  <p>But I have a problem with the design, and why?, easy, because I'm not a designer, and I like it so much
  that I can't <strike>copy</strike> <strong>create</strong> a design that fits my expectations. So I would
  like to share this project with someone who wants to make it a great and funny job.</p>
  <h3 class="BlogPost-contentSubtitle">What can I offer?</h3>
  <p>No money, it will be an open source project when it is ready, so if you look for that, stop reading.
  I can offer the half of the project, fun time working with someone peculiar, create a useful webtool,...</p>
  <h3 class="BlogPost-contentSubtitle">Are there any conditions?</h3>
  <p>No, there aren't. However my spoken languages are english and spanish. And I would like to release the
  project before end of May (I'm a dreamer), so if you are busy the next two months...</p>
  <p>This is not a hiring process, or something similar, there won't be money (it has to be clear), I just
  want to share something I really love and make it real. Actually, I'm asking for help :) . If you want to
  know more about libr.in write an email to <a href="mailto:tengoun@libr.in" title="Librin">tengoun@libr.in</a>.</p>
