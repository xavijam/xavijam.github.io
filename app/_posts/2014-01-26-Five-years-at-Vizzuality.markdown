      There is no a better moment to start again with my blog, celebrating my fifth anniversary at Vizzuality. After my first years in this wadusfera I can only say thanks to the team and the people who have worked here.

      I could say we have done things (some we can't mention) that we are proud. Lot of projects, with great companies, things that mattered. 
      But this adventure hasn't finished and we are ready for new opportunities, and this year is gonna be special.
      <br/><br/>
      I usually like to remember that we were 5 years ago working in a small room in <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=calle%20angosta%20de%20los%20mancebos,%20madrid">La Latina</a>, tons of dreams, and today I keep them present. If someone asks me about my future, I'd say the same as before. Keeping the feeling what I do is important.

      My gift for this birthday is a <a href="http://xavij.am/luisoundsystem">small audio player</a><sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>, using <a href="http://twitter.com/luisico">@luisico</a>'s sounds playing FIFA :D. If you know him, you will know how expressive he is.
      <br/><br/>
      Thanks to all the team for the recordings, to <a href="http://twitter.com/ferdev">@ferdev</a> for splitting the audio files into separate tracks and finally to <a href="http://twitter.com/damagedgoods">@damagedgoods</a> for designing something for this purpose :).
      <br/><br/>
      So, I hope I finish my website soon, and later a visualization I've been developing lately.
      Writing a post every two weeks, ... Let's see if it is possible.
      <br/><br/>
      New year, new purposes.
